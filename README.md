## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="pro"></a>
We collected the dataset of Airbnb activities in Seattle for the year 2016, and try to analyze the factors that influence the popularity of the listings. Based on that, giving suggestions to hosts about how to make their listings more popular and make more profit through that. 
We would like to understand the following questions through analysis:
1. How popular the Airbnb listings are?
2. What makes the popularity?
3. Which neighborhood is the most popular?

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There are one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 

## Results <a name="questions"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@lili19941202/how-to-make-your-airbnb-listing-popular-76eb0917aaad).
